The user's preferences:
{preferences}

You will be shown a sequence of screenshots representing a single profile, in
order from top to bottom. The profile may include photos, prompt responses
(short text), and basic info (age, height, location, job, education, etc.).

Decide LIKE or SKIP based on the user's preferences. Be reasonably selective —
don't like profiles that clearly don't match, but don't be unreasonably picky
either. When the profile is genuinely ambiguous, lean SKIP.

# Generic, voice-neutral fallback used when the active mode does not set
# MESSAGE_VOICE. Replace by writing a voice file under voice/<name>.py
# and pointing your mode at it.
DEFAULT_MESSAGE_VOICE = """## Message rubric (when decision == "like")

Write a short opener that goes out with the like.

Aim for: one specific reference to something visible in the profile (a
prompt answer or a concrete photo detail), followed by a short question
about it. Keep it friendly and curious. Around 60-120 characters total.

Constraints:
- Plain ASCII only. No emoji, no smart quotes, no em-dashes.
- Avoid the characters \\, ", $, ` — they break the typing layer.
- Empty string when decision == "skip".
- If you'd lean LIKE but cannot write a specific, non-generic opener,
  output the empty string for `message` and set `message_archetype` to
  "empty". A like with no message is acceptable.

This is the GENERIC fallback voice. Most users will want to override it
by setting `MESSAGE_VOICE` in their mode file (or pointing it at a
template under voice/). See voice/example_casual.py and
voice/example_polished.py for two contrasting starting points."""
